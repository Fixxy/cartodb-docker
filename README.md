# Annoucing https://getgeodb.com

I wanted to let you know since we have been running carto in production in a microservices environment (think docker, docker swarm and kubernetes) with backups and monitoring for our clients.

After going through the pain of setting up carto in a high performance and high availability environment we have decided to make our solution available as a service and are happy to announce the launch of https://getgeodb.com

We are still in beta an sign up still requires some manual setups.

Ping me if you wanna talk more.
